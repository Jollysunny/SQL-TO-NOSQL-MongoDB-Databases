# SQL-TO-NOSQL-MongoDB-Databases
This directory features my project under Dr. RAMEZ ELMASRI for Relational to NOSQL document type databases. In this project, I imported a well-structured database in SQL to Unstructured database in MongoDB using PyMongo to connect Mongo client using Python .

The Python files create different views that were required in the assignment.
